00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Whoa! Whoa! [trembles]

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,760
What's happening to you?!

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,800
My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,280
sense is going off!

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,900
That means a song is coming on!

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,660
Take a look at everything around you

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,480
All the smells that surely will astound you

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,900
Open up your heart, it will surround you

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,220
In the magic of Hearth's Warming Eve

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,220
The little things that make it better

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,820
Little ponies spreading cheer

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,540
Give a toy, a hug, a sweater

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,300
Memories that last all year

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,540
The present's always filled with presents

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,480
Large, medium, and small

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,580
Sometimes the most important things

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,840
Aren't very big at all

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:59,460
[tap-dancing solo]

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,320
What a party, there's so much to see here

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,060
Can't believe you didn't want to be here

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,860
You'd have had a blast, I guarantee here

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,820
This is the spirit of Hearth's Warming Eve

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,000
Cider's flowing, this is living

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,320
Come on and feel the beat

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,420
Life is better when you're giving

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,980
Each time you do it feels so sweet

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,240
The present's always filled with presents

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,600
So come on, open your eyes

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,040
Spend time with ponies just like you

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,820
And watch your spirits rise

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,060
The present's always filled with presents

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,780
Take a look around

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,020
The reason for the holiday

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,400
Is quite easily found

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Yes, the reason for the holiday

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,400
Is quite easily found

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,300
And the reason is to be with your friends!
